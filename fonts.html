        <h1>Bellefair</h1>
        <h2>by Nick Shinn</h2>
        <p>
          Bellefair started life as a Latin typeface designed by Nick Shinn. Then a
          Hebrew typeface was designed as part of the project by Liron Lavi Turkenich,
          to be a good match in terms of style, weight and overall color. The Bellefair
          project is led by Shinntype, a type design foundry based in Toronto, Canada.

          I like this font because it is easy to read and very calming. It is interesting
          and inviting to readers.

        <h1>Handlee</h1>
        <h2>by Joe Prine</h2>
        <p>
          Handlee is loosely based on the handwriting of typographer Joe Prince. Its
          inconsistent curves give it a nice, human-like quality that is reflected in
          the characters. Each glyph is stationed at a different position in respect
          to the baseline, and ascenders and descenders vary, which all contribute to
          the human-like qualities of the font.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like this font because, although it is handwriting, it is easy to read.
          I normally stay away from handwritten fonts, but this one is very easy to
          read and doesn't crowd and space it is in.

      <div id="incon" class="font-container">
        <h1>Inconsolata</h1>
        <h2>by Raph Levien</h2>
        <p>
          Inconsolata was Raph Levien's first serious original font release. It is a
          monospace font, designed for printed code listings and the like. There are
          a great many “programmer fonts,” designed primarily for use on the screen,
          but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution
          rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like handwritten fonts, I also try and stay away from monospace fonts, as
          I think the letter spacing is too uncomfortable for me eyes to read
          comfortably. But, I do like Inconsolata because the text stays calm and
          inviting while being clean and having an appropriate amount of space
          between letters.

        <h1>Pontano Sans</h1>
        <h2>by Vernon Adams</h2>
        <p>
          Pontano Sans is a minimalist and light weighted
          Sans Serif. Pontano is designed mainly for use as a display font but is useable
          as a text font too. Pontano Sans has been designed to be used freely across
          the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like this font because it is elegant and clean. To me, this font portrays
          class and organization and keeps words looking clean and easy to read.
