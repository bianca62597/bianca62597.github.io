        <h4>Wine</h4>
        <img src="img/me.jpg" />
        <p>
          Being Italian, wine is a huge part of my family’s culture, so wine is
          a must everywhere we go.
        </p>

      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Climbing Shoes</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          I always carry my climbing shoes with me in hopes that I find a good
          rock to climb!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Coffee</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          If I don’t start a day with coffee, I probably won’t be able to drag
          myself out of bed. It’s a necessity!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Aeropress</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          If I’m going to need coffee everyday, I might as well make the best
          cup possible using my beloved Aeropress.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Baseball Glove</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          One of my favorite pastimes is playing catch with my friends! I always
          carry my glove and a baseball in case I have time to play catch.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Cubs Jersey</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          One of my most prized possessions is my Anthony Rizzo jersey. It’s my
          first real jersey that I got myself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>"W" Flag</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          You never know where you’ll be when the Cubs win! I have to have my
          “W” (win) flag with me so I can fly it whenever the Cubs win!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Camera</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          I love capturing memories with my Canon camera. I carry it with me
          whenever I can and have captured some of the coolest things I’ve
          ever seen with it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Sketchbook</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          Since I became an interior architecture and design student, I have
          grown to enjoy sketching my own ideas/things around me, so I always
          have a small sketchpad with me.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Nalgene</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          I spent a semester in the Rocky Mountains my first semester of
          college, and ever since then I’ve learned how important it is to stay
          hydrated. I don’t leave the house without a full liter Nalgene of
          water!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Sunglasses</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          It’s a guarantee that wherever I am, my sunglasses are within one
          foot of me at all times. I have never gone anywhere without my
          sunglasses and I probably never will.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Hair Tie</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          I love to keep my hair off of my neck and out of my face, especially
          because I work with kids, so having at least two hair ties with me at
          all times (one as a backup in case one breaks) is a necessity.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Coconut Oil Candle</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          The crazy thing about this candle is that the wax doesn’t get hot when
          it melts, so you can dip your fingers in it and use it as moisturizer
          for your hands, feet, etc. It works reall well because of the coconut
          oil in it! It is available at the Treasure Island Flea Market
          (visit <a href="http://www.treasureislandflea.com/about">http://www.treasureislandflea.com/about</a>
          for more information).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4><em>Lost</em> -- The Complete Collection</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          My favorite TV series is Lost, so, anywhere I am I’ll need a copy of
          all six seasons of it. I take it very seriously (contact me to discuss
          theories).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Guinea Pigs</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          The two, small, fluffy loves of my life, Tina and Louise, are
          necessary to my survival. They’re sassy, cuddly little fluffballs
          that are on a strict eat-sleep-eat-sleep schedule. What’s not to love?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Drumsticks</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          I love to keep my drumsticks with me and keep a beat on any surface I
          can find.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Earbuds</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          Music is a huge part of my life, so of course I love to have a way to
          privately enjoy my music anywhere I am. I always carry earbuds with
          me for easy access to the music that I love to listen to so much!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Suzy the Miata</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          My other most prized possession is my car, Suzy. She’s a manual Miata
          and I can’t imagine life without her.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Chapstick</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          Everyone who knows me knows that if they ever need chapstick when
          they’re around me, they’re in luck. I always have at least one tube
          of chapstick with me!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit-element">
        <h4>Favorite Blanket</h4>
        <img src="img/wine.jpg" />
        <p>
          This blanket is so soft that it can put me to sleep in an instant
          anywhere I am. I wish it was acceptable to carry a blanket around 24/7
          because I hate leaving this blanket in my bed every morning.
