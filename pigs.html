    <h1>Guinea Pigs!!</h1>
    <p>
      I have two guinea pigs, <a href="#pig1">Tina</a> and <a href="#pig2">Louise</a>! They really like to eat fresh
       vegetables, and their favorite snack is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander"> cilantro</a> (pictured below).

      Tina's birthday is June 28th, and Louise's birthday is February 14th.
       Below are the pictures I took of them on their most
        recent birthdays!
